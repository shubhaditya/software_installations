#%%% Run config, with --prefix flag for a local build and CC, CXX and FC to specify compilers, e.g. CC=/home-research/shubhadm/packages/gcc_local/bin/gcc. Probably also need to specify CCFLAGS/FCFLAGS if 
#%%% the compiler gives an error, usually due to library linking e.g. FCFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath,/home-research/shubhadm/packages/gcc_local/lib64). For gcc version>4.6, will also require CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS with "-fgnu89-inline" to prevent redundant inline definitions of certain functions. You may require CPPFLAGS to include additional directories for including header files for e.g. CPPFLAGS="-I /home-research/shubhadm/packages/gcc_local/include/c++/5.2.0 -I /home-research/shubhadm/packages/gcc_local/include/c++/5.2.0/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
